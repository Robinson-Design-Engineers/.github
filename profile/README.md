## Robinson Design Engineers
Robinson Design Engineers (RDE) is an award-winning team of hydrologists and engineers engaged in thoughtful, creative problem-solving and design for land, water, and ecology.

We offer specialized engineering design expertise for projects such as urban creek restoration, living shorelines, stream bank stabilization, green roof hydrology, salt marsh restoration, low-tech stream & wetland restoration, mitigation banking, and dam removal. As experts in the field of Environmental Hydrology, we also conduct field-based studies and numerical analyses for challenging problems associated with compound flooding, sediment management, hydraulic structures, watershed planning, and hydrodynamics of natural systems.

We specialize in nature-based engineering to water management issues, including:
- Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration
- Stormwater Management
- Erosion and Sedimentation
- Flooding and Resilience

## RDE Labs

RDE Labs advances the design and implementation of natural, process-based approaches to water resources engineering through Research, Development, and Education.
