<br />
Robinson Design Engineers (RDE) is an award-winning team of hydrologists and engineers engaged in thoughtful, creative problem-solving and design for land, water, and ecology.

<br />
We offer specialized engineering design expertise for projects such as urban creek restoration, living shorelines, stream bank stabilization, green roof hydrology, salt marsh restoration, low-tech stream & wetland restoration, mitigation banking, and dam removal. As experts in the field of Environmental Hydrology, we also conduct field-based studies and numerical analyses for challenging problems associated with compound flooding, sediment management, hydraulic structures, watershed planning, and hydrodynamics of natural systems.

<br />
We specialize in nature-based engineering to water management issues, including:
- Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration
- Stormwater Management
- Erosion and Sedimentation
- Flooding and Resilience
